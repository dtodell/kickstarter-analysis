# kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

Headers are signified with a #. The number of hashtags indicates the level of the header. For example, ### is a third-level header.
Bullets are added in three ways: a typical bullet with an asterisk, a numbered bullet with numbers, or a hyphenated bullet with a hyphen.
Images can be added with the following syntax: ![image_name](path/to/image_name.png).
Hyperlinks to relevant files are  added in a similar manner: [filename](path/to/filename.xlxs).
Line breaks are added by using three consecutive hyphens: ---.
