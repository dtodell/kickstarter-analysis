# Overview of Project
This analysis is to show our client, Louise, the best strategy for funding a KickStarter campaign for her play. This project analyzes similar KickStarters that may help to model her campaign from.

## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis:
Generally, it’s best to have a Launch Date in the summer months and set a funding goal of less than $15,000, ideally less than $1,000.
Outcomes based on month of launch shows the Summer months tend to perform best:

Outcomes vs Goal shows which Goal targets tend to perform the best:

### Challenges:
Challenges included getting the variables, columns, etc., in the correct order in the Pivot-tables to display the right data. Luckily the data was ‘clean’ already and didn’t require scrubbing. Most data sets in the real world will likely have incomplete, incorrect, or duplicate data, so I’ll have to keep an eye out for that if we update it.

## Results:
### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?
1. Summer months are typically more popular than other months.
2. Holiday season (November-December) is typically least popular.
### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Goals ranging under $1000 are the most successful at over 70% funded, while 60% of goals were met when set under $15000. There’s additional success with over 60% goals met when goals were set between $35000-$45000.

## Things to consider:
### What are some limitations of this dataset?
This dataset is quite old; the average year being 2014 and mode being 2015, so I’d like to see more current data, and since it’s old and we now have to consider the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and another war, a refresh may show a change in taste, whether for a different genre of play, timing/season for attending the theater, etc.
### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
1. Plotting success rate for each donation level can help Louise target the right demographic to market the campaign to.
2. Plotting Outcomes based on launch date *and* Country can help Louise ensure she runs the show at the right time and place (e.g. England will have different attendance than Australia in any given month due to opposing seasons).
